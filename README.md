App for catalouging bills by scanning their QR (or other codes)

## Status
The app (for now) only has primitive functionality, where you can only scan bills, see them, see their digital copy and inspect their contents

You can also, (for organization sake) add personal notes and names to stores and the receipts themselves.

## How it works?

It first scans the QR and inspects it for content, however some of that content may be online and therefore would need an online sync.
This either happens automatically when you scan the bill or later when you manually initiate the option to do so.
This app plans to add many more features, but for now only the core functionality exists, the essential building blocks if you will.

## What bills are supported?

Currently only bills issues by TaxCore are supported, that would be bills from:
 - Bosnia & Herzegovina
 - Serbia

I have plans to add many other countries because I'm trying to build the app in a way that would allow you to process data from many other sources.

## Gdje domaći prevod?

Lijenčuga sam pa mi se nije dalo, slobodno promeni taj strings.xml I uradi to sam.

## License

GPLv3 or later

This may change, but I don't want people commercializing this crap without giving back.
